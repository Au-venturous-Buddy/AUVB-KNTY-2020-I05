<h3>Shack Stack</h3>
Of their burgers, the Shack Burger and the 'Shroom Burger are among the best-sellers, and I could not choose between them! Fortunately, there is the Shack Stack, which is the best of both worlds! It is a cheeseburger with a 'shroom burger (a deep-fried portobello mushroom stuffed with gooey muenster and cheddar cheeses), and topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce, all in a potato bun. The cheeseburger tastes very meaty, and the 'Shroom burger is very crispy, warm, and oozing with the cheeses! They REALLY do go well together!
