<h3>Crinkle Cut Fries</h3>
And then there are the Crinkle Fries, which are not like the usual french fries served in fast-food restaurants. They have scallopped edges, which is actually an advantage when it comes to dipping it in either ketchup or mustard, since the sauce can easily stick onto the fries. But what I like about these fries is that they are very crispy yet soft and pillowy!

Other well-known SHAKE SHACK food items include the SmokeShack (a cheeseburger topped with applewood smoked bacon, diced cherry pepper, and ShackSauce in a potato bun), ShackBurger (the original which is a cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce in a potato bun), and Root Beer Float (which is less of root beer and more on the creaminess of the frozen custard, and the taste is not what you expect from the usual strength of a popular root beer float brand).

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In all, SHAKE SHACK is definitely something to add on your bucket list! The decorations are very colorful and vibrant, and their burgers are really tasty and meaty! One note though: Most of their products (the Calamansi Lime-ade is one exception) are quite greasy and fatty that you will easily feel full, so make this your guilty pleasure once in a while!
